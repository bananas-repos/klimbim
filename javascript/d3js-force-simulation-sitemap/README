This is an example of https://github.com/d3/d3-force and sitemap like data.

Source data is a directory like structure of paths which can be
easily extracted from a sitemap.xml file.

The /root is needed in the paths since the individual parts are split
by / and thus the root will be empty.

Zoom and pan are implemented.
